> ***Note:*** _This homework is OPTIONAL. It can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

## Exercise

After Retrofit, the next most popular neworking library for Android is Google's Volley. In this optional homework, you will use the [Volley documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html) as a guide and implement Volley to make network calls to Walmart's API.

#### Requirements

- Replicate your [Networking in Android Lab](https://github.com/ga-adi-nyc/networking-in-android-lab) using Volley to make all your network calls
- Make the same calls to the [Walmart API](https://developer.walmartlabs.com/io-docs) that you made for the lab, and display the products to your user
- Use Volley's `RequestQueue` to perform API calls asynchronously on a worker thread (instead of the AsyncTask approach used in the lab)

**Bonus:**
- If a user clicks on of the product buttons while a network request is still pending, cancel the existing request and launch the new one

#### Starter code

You have three options:

1. Build this app from scratch
1. Start with your code from the [Networking in Android Lab](https://github.com/ga-adi-nyc/networking-in-android-lab)
1. Start with the solution code from the [Networking in Android Lab](https://github.com/ga-adi-nyc/networking-in-android-lab)

#### Deliverable

This is an optional homework. If you choose to complete it, submit a pull request with your completed app and you will receive feedback.
